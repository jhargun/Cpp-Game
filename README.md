## C++ Game

This repo contains code for a command line game implemented in C++. The goal with this game was to make use of multiple design patterns, such as the decorator and observer patterns, as well as multiple C++ idioms, such as the NVI (non-virtual interface) and RAII (resource aquisition is initialization) idioms, to make the code robust and readable. All of the source code, as well as a makefile, is in the src/ folder. Run the executable created by this makefile to play the game.

The uml_diagram explaining the architecture of the code is in uml_diagram.pdf

The full documentation, which gives a high level overview of each class as well as the reasoning behind some design decisions, is in documentation.pdf
